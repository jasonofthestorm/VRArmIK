# VRArmIK
VRArmIK brings arms into VR without any additional tracking devices. 
Using head and hand positions, the shoulders and arms are estimated to create realistic arm movements.

This fork has been modified to pose the shoulders based on the Avatar's local rotation, which can be useful in games like flight simulators where a player might be doing flips and rolls.
